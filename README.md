## Introduction
The goal of this project is to accurately predict rent prices by analyzing features such as location, property size, number of rooms, and more. Various machine learning techniques are used and evaluated for performance, with the aim of creating an optimized prediction model.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/demirelfth/rent-prediction.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd rent-prediction
  ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start training models using the provided scripts.

1. Preprocess the data:
  ```bash
  python preprocess.py
  ```
2. Train the model:
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
3. Evaluate the model:
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py
  ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of real-world rental price data, including features like:

  * Location (latitude, longitude)
  * Property size (square meters)
  * Number of rooms
  * Building age
  * Additional features like furnished status, heating type, etc.

Make sure to clean and preprocess the dataset before training the model.

## Modeling
This project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)

We evaluate these models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results
The performance of each model is benchmarked, and the best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and generalization ability. Final results will be shared in the form of graphs and tables.
